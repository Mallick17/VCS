# Version Control System (VCS)
- VCS are a category of softwaretools that helps in recording made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.
- Version control is also known as **Revision Control, Source Control & Source Code Management.**
- Version control is a component of software configuration management.
- Version Control includes viewing old versions & enables reverting a file to previous version.
- Benefits of version control systems:
  - A complete long-term change history of every file.
  - Branching and merging.
  - Traceability.
- There are three types of VCS
  - Localized VCS
  - Centralized VCS
  - Distributed VCS

### Localized VCS
- It is one of the simplest forms and has a database that kept all the changes to files under Revision Control System (RCS).
- RCS is the most common VCS tools.
- It keeps patch sets (difference between files) in a special format on disk.
- By adding up all the patches it can then recreate what any file at anypoint in time.
### Centralized VCS
- Centralized VCS contain just one repository globally & every user need to commit for reflecting ones changes in the repository.
- It is possible for others to see your changes by updating.
- Two things are required to make your changes visible to others which are
  - You Commit
  - They Update
## Distributed VCS
- Distributed VCS contain multiple repositories.
- Each user has their own repo & working copy.
- When you update, you do not get others changes unless you have first pulled those changes into your repo.
- To make changes visible to others, 4 things are required
  - You Commit
  - You Push
  - They Pull
  - They Update
- The most popular distributed VCS are Git, Mercurial, BitBucket.
- They helps us overcome the problem of single point of failure.


# Git
**GIT = Global Information Tracker**
- Git is open source, distributed version control tool to achieve collabration with each & every developers. where we can track each & every modification or changes & we can have more control over each version of the code.
- Benefits are **Feature Branch Overflow, Distributed Development, Pull Requests, Community, Faster Release Cycle**
